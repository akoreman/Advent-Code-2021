# Advent of Code 2021
WIP. Belatedly working through the algorithmic puzzles of advent of code 2021, in C++.  
Current star tally: 8.

Completed:
- 1-1 & 1-2
- 2-1 & 2-2
- 3-1
- 7-1 & 7-2
- 8-1

Improvements to do:

- Day 1-2 needs to be done in a more general way.
- Day 7 is now done using a brute force search, this can be done more efficient.
